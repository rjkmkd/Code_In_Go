# Go Basics ðŸš€

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning journey! This repository contains exercises, code snippets, and projects that Iâ€™ve worked on while learning the fundamentals of Go.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- Basic Go syntax and language features
- Simple algorithms and exercises
- Experimenting with Go's concurrency model and channels (coming soon)

## Why Go?
Go is a powerful, statically typed, and compiled language designed for simplicity and high performance. Itâ€™s ideal for building scalable applications, especially in cloud-native environments.
