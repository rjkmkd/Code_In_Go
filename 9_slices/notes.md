Explanation of Concepts in the Code
Slices vs. Arrays:

Unlike arrays, slices are dynamic, meaning their size can grow or shrink. Slices are more flexible and commonly used in Go.
Nil Slices:

An uninitialized slice is nil and has a length of 0. Attempting to access or modify elements without initialization will cause runtime errors.
Creating Slices with make:

The make function initializes a slice with a specified length and capacity, e.g., make([]int, 0, 3) creates a slice with length 0 and capacity 3.
Appending Elements to a Slice:

Slices can grow dynamically using append, which adjusts the slice's length and, if necessary, its capacity.
Slice Operators:

The slice operator [:] can be used to extract portions of a slice:
nums[0:] returns all elements from index 0 onward.
nums[0:2] returns elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 2.
Comparing Slices:

The commented slices.Equal(num1, num2) function from the slices package allows slice comparisons, as slices cannot be compared directly in Go except with this utility.
Copying Slices:

The copy(destination, source) function allows elements of one slice to be copied to another. The destination slice must have enough length to hold the copied elements.
Capacity and Length of a Slice:

len(nums) gives the current number of elements.
cap(nums) gives the capacity, which grows as elements are added, dynamically managed by Go's memory allocator.
