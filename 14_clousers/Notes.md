Explanation of Concepts in the Code
Closures:

A closure is a function that captures and remembers the values of variables from its surrounding scope.
Here, count is a variable within the counter function, and the returned anonymous function forms a closure around it, retaining access to count even after counter has exited.
Function Returning a Function:

The counter function returns another function (func() int) that has access to count.
Every call to getCounter() in main refers to this returned function, which can modify and return the value of count.
State Preservation Across Function Calls:

When counter is called, count is initialized to zero, but each subsequent call to getCounter() retains and increments the same count value.
This creates a counter that holds state across multiple function calls, even though count would normally be out of scope once counter completes.
Use Cases of Closures:

Closures are ideal for cases where you need to maintain state across repeated function calls, such as counters, accumulators, or managing configuration values.
In this example, closures enable getCounter to maintain the value of count without relying on global state.
