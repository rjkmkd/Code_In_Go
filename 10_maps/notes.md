Explanation of Concepts in the Code
Map Basics:

Maps in Go are key-value data structures that store associations between keys and values. A map is created with make(map[keyType]valueType).
Example: m := make(map[string]string) creates a map with string keys and string values.
Adding Elements to a Map:

Elements are added or updated by assigning a value to a key, like m["name"] = "goLang".
If the key exists, its value is updated. If it doesn’t, it’s added.
Accessing Elements and Zero Values:

fmt.Println(m["key"]) prints the value associated with the key.
Accessing a nonexistent key returns the zero value for the type (empty string "" for string, 0 for int, and false for bool).
Checking for Key Existence with ok Idiom:

value, ok := m["key"] lets you check if a key exists in the map.
If ok is true, the key exists, and value holds the associated value. If ok is false, the key is absent, and value is the zero value of the value type.
Map Initialization with Literal Syntax:

A map can be initialized with values directly, e.g., map[string]int{"age": 30}.
Comparing Maps Using maps.Equal:

The maps.Equal(m1, m2) function from the maps package compares two maps to check if they have identical key-value pairs. If all key-value pairs match, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
Without the maps package, direct map comparisons aren’t allowed in Go, so manual comparisons are needed.
