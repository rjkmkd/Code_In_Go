Explanation of Concepts in the Code
Generics in Go:

Go introduced generics (type parameters) to allow functions and types to work with any data type without sacrificing type safety.
In this example, the function printSlice and the stack type make use of generics to operate on multiple types (like int, string, bool, etc.) without needing separate definitions for each type.
Type Constraints:

We use constraints to restrict which types the generic can accept. Constraints like int | string | bool | float32 restrict the types to only these specific types.
The comparable constraint is applied to ensure the type T used in printSlice is comparable (supports equality checks).
Multiple Type Parameters:

printSlice[T comparable, s string] demonstrates how multiple type parameters can be specified. Here, T is constrained to comparable types, and s is fixed as string.
Defining Generic Data Structures:

The stack struct is defined as a generic data structure. By specifying [T int | string | bool | float32], we allow only these types to be used in stack.
Instantiation of Generic Types:

In the main function, two instances of stack are created (Mystack with int and Mystack1 with string).
