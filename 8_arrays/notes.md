Explanation of Concepts in the Code
Array Declarations:

Arrays in Go are fixed-size and must have their size specified at declaration.
Arrays hold values of a single data type, like int, string, bool, or float64.
Default Values of Arrays:

Integer Arrays: Default values are 0.
String Arrays: Default values are empty strings "".
Boolean Arrays: Default values are false.
Float Arrays: Default values are 0.0.
Accessing and Modifying Array Elements:

Array elements are accessed using their indices (e.g., nums[0]).
Modifying an array involves directly assigning values to specific indices, e.g., nums[0] = 6.
2D Arrays (Matrices):

A 2D array is an array of arrays, which can be initialized with a nested array format.
In matrix := [2][2]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, matrix is a 2x2 integer array, with each row initialized to specified values.
Using range with Arrays:

range can be used to iterate over arrays, accessing either values or indices of elements.
In commented code, for i := range nums is an example of using range to iterate over array indices.
Array Initialization with Values:

Arrays can be initialized with values during declaration by specifying values within braces, as in names := [2]string{"ghg", "gvggh"}.
This example shows the basics of array manipulation in Go, including initialization, default values, accessing/modifying elements, and working with multidimensional arrays.
